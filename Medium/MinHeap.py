Min-Heap
1. A min-heap is a binary tree such that the data contained in each node is less
than(or equal to) the data in that node’s children.
2. the binary tree is complete
3. Root node is the min element in the tree

Max-Heap
1. A max-heap is a binary tree such that the data contained in each node
is greater than (or equal to) the data in that node’s children.
2. the binary tree is complete
3. Root node is the max element in the tree

Heap can be represented as an array -


Note -
- A full binary tree (sometimes proper binary tree or 2-tree) is a tree in which
  every node other than the leaves has two children.
- A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly
  the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.
